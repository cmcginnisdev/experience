      <h2>Note Card 1</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Main Point:</strong> Agile Manifesto prioritizes individuals and interactions over processes and tools, working software over comprehensive documentation, customer collaboration over contract negotiation, and responding to change over following a plan.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Details:</strong> Agile Manifesto was codified in 2001 in Snowbird by Scrum, XP, and DSDM practitioners. These values are fundamental to why agile works and continues to be used on projects with high uncertainty today.

      <h2>Note Card 2</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Main Point:</strong> Sprint basics include Sprint Planning, Sprint Development, and Sprint Retro & Review, with a Sprint being a timebox for completing work, usually ranging from two weeks to a month.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Details:</strong> Sprint Planning starts with the Product Owner selecting work from the Product Backlog. The Sprint Development focuses on daily reporting and execution against selected stories, facilitated by the Scrum Master. Sprint Retro & Review are ceremonies for gaining feedback and driving continuous improvement.

      <h2>Note Card 3</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Main Point:</strong> The Iron Triangle explains project management methods, including Agile, Traditional, and Lean, each with varying constraints on scope, schedule, and budget.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Details:</strong> Scope, schedule, and budget are all constraints and costs to the organization. Understanding these constraints is crucial for effective project management in any methodology.

      <h2>Note Card 4</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Main Point:</strong> Agile focuses on speed and flexibility, Traditional on efficiency, and Lean on innovation, with each method requiring specific goals and expertise.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Details:</strong> Agile projects require a shared vision, whole teams, incremental delivery, continuous integration & testing, and frameworks like Scrum, SAFe, or Disciplined Agile for successful implementation.

      <h2>Note Card 5</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Main Point:</strong> False comparisons across types of projects abound.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Details:</strong> Many times objections one hears about using Agile is that it's missing critical elements, such as design, testing, or documentation. These are all wrong. In fact, every project must have the following to be successful: Charter, Plan, Documentation, Design, Testing.

      <h2>Note Card 6</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Main Point:</strong> Every Agile project needs shared vision robust to change, whole teams, incremental delivery, and continuous integration & testing.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Details:</strong> These elements help in minimizing scope to target just what the customer needs, reducing waste by delivering a minimum viable product (MVP) that meets project objectives.

      <h2>Note Card 7</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Main Point:</strong> Scrum, SAFe, or Disciplined Agile are frameworks that help define roles and processes to scale and implement Agile methodology.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Details:</strong> They provide a shared language, but the method remains the same.
