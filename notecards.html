          <strong>Main Point:</strong> False comparisons across types of projects abound, such as objections that Agile is missing critical elements like design, testing, or documentation.
          <br><br>
          <strong>Details:</strong> Every successful project, regardless of methodology, must have key elements including a charter, plan, documentation, design, and testing. Agile methodologies prioritize varying scope to target what the customer needs, reducing waste by delivering a minimum viable product (MVP) that meets project objectives.
