            <h2>Agile Manifesto</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Main Point:</strong> Agile Manifesto prioritizes individuals and interactions over processes and tools, working software over comprehensive documentation, customer collaboration over contract negotiation, and responding to change over following a plan.
              <br><br>
              <strong>Details:</strong> Codified in 2001 in Snowbird by Scrum, XP, and DSDM practitioners. These values are fundamental to why agile works and continues to be used on projects with high uncertainty today.

              <br><br>
              <strong>Details:</strong> Teams analyze, build, and test the work, facilitated by the Scrum Master. Meetings are held, and the Product Owner determines if a Story is complete to meet stakeholder needs.

            <h2>Iron Triangle</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Main Point:</strong> The Iron Triangle includes Scope, Schedule, and Budget, which are constraints and costs to the organization in project management.
              <br><br>
              <strong>Details:</strong> More schedule means a delay of project benefits, more budget means more capital invested, and more scope means a larger product to support or maintain.

            <p>
              <strong>Main Point:</strong> Three types of project management are Agile, Traditional, and Lean, each varying constraints on scope, schedule, and budget.
              <br><br>

            <h2>False Comparisons</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Main Point:</strong> False comparisons across types of projects abound, such as objections that Agile is missing critical elements like design, testing, or documentation.
              <br><br>
              <strong>Details:</strong> Every successful project must have key elements including a charter, plan, documentation, design, and testing. Agile methodologies prioritize varying scope to target what the customer needs, delivering a minimum viable product (MVP).

            <h2>Agile Project Essentials</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Main Point:</strong> Agile projects require shared vision robust to change, whole teams, incremental delivery, and continuous integration & testing.
              <br><br>
              <strong>Details:</strong> Frameworks like Scrum, SAFe, or Disciplined Agile help define roles and processes to scale Agile methodologies, providing a shared language while the method remains consistent.
